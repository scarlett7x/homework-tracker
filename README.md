# Homework Tracker

One of the biggest struggles a lot of college students have is missing deadlines. Overwhelmed by homework, readings, and projects, students might find it hard to navigate through different class systems and websites to find out the deadlines, especially when dealing with multiple classes. Homework Tracker generates a personalized dashboard with up-to-date assignment information based on user-input links. Besides, users can choose to integrate the dashboard with the calendar on their phone, so they will receive notifications when deadlines come up.

### UI/UX Design

My Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/6lfAQCR37SLiT2PCx3gqK1/HomeworkPlanner?node-id=4315%3A14893

Before we finalized features, I created prototypes to visualize functionality that might help us approach our goal. To make the app easy to use, we decided to implement the following user interfaces:

1) Login: Users can choose to create a new account with their email or sign in with google.
2) Class Set-up: Users provide the class names and corresponding URL links to class websites to generate a dashboard.
3) Dashboard: By web scraping those websites, the app brings a dashboard of classes with all the assignments coming up. Users can scroll up and down to check different classes they are in, and scroll left and right to see the assignments with deadlines. Below the dashboard, they can turn on the switch to integrate the information with the calendar.
4) Assignment Information: By clicking on any assignment, users will be redirected to a web view of related information.

### System and Device Supported

The deployment targets iOS 13.2 and higher and supports iPhone and iPad.
